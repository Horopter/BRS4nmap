Basic Reconnaissance Scanner for NMAP

The fundamental tests to be performed for security check in network penetration are exactly five in number.
According to the EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker material, successful black hat operations typically
follow five phases: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, and Covering Tracks.
In this repo I have included the automated system that can essentially perform multiple reconnaissance and
scanning (dubbed as reconnaissance scanning) for multiple sites. The limitations are hugely the limitations
of the language itself.

R is a statistical and analytical tool that helps in data visualization and thematic analysis. As opposed the
much hyped Python, R is purely algorithmic and cross platform. One of the perks of R is that it compiles to
native C++ which if you think is highly portable, customizable and debuggable. However this leads to one 
typical notion and that is R is slow. Yeah, for small data R may seem pretty slow but it exceeds expectations
once we jump into Big data. 

This repo is a port from the conventional Python automizers in the market. I have taken the liberty to use 
tdlextract for my needs. The repo itself is a bit rusty but it helped my by and large.
I hope to extend this to a much larger base in near future.
